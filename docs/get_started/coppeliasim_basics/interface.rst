.. note::
    If you are using a high resolution display and the user interface looks too small, you
    could set the parameter :file:`highResDisplay=2` in the configuration file :file:`usrset.txt`.

    To know where the :file:`usrset.txt` is, you can type in the Lua commander the following:

    .. code-block:: python

        sim.getStringParam(sim.stringparam_usersettingsdir)
