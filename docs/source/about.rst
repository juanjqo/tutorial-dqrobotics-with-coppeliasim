About this tutorial
===================

.. note:: 
   This tutorial requires basic concepts about dual quaternion algebra,
   DQ Robotics, and CoppeliaSim. If those topics are unfamiliar to you, this tutorial **is not** for you.
   
.. tip::
   If you want to learn more about robot modeling and control using dual quaternion algebra, check out this amazing `book. <https://hal.science/hal-01478225v1>`_

.. hint::   
   We recommend taking this awesome `course <https://github.com/dqrobotics/learning-dqrobotics-in-matlab/tree/master>`_ in DQ Robotics (Matlab)
   before taking this tutorial.

.. tip:: 
   Learn more about CoppeliaSim in its `official documentation. <https://www.coppeliarobotics.com/helpFiles/index.html>`_

   
This tutorial is designed to get you started with DQ Robotics and CoppeliaSim.
